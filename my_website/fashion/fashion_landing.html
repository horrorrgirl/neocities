        <h2>current outfit ideas I'm considering</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> <span class="done">[DONE]</span> jean shorts + the white tights I own? + some sort of visible sock + big gray boots (altho its summer so idk)</li>
            <li> the mary janes i just got + knee high frill socks + leg warmers ? or just in general styling the mary janes</li>
            <li> the pink/white coquette lingerie thing i own + bright pink open stomach top? genuinely not sure this iwll look good tbh. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>some of my fav layering methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> skirt + visible shorts underneath (ie lace skirt + jean shorts). I think works best w/ tights but I haven't been able to experiment too much w/ this yet</li>
          <li> layering skirt directly underneath top s.t. skirt hem hits ~hip or so (usually top is babydoll or somewhat loose bc ts looks weird w/ fitted since it's lumpy underneath. Although I think if the skirt is thin enough fitted works - and babydoll > loose because the shape is a lot better defined i think; it kinda looks like a dress). Basically like those wearing those korean lace wrap skirts or tops w/ ruffles at hem but I don't own those</li>
          <li></li>
